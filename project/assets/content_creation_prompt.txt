IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON. No additional text, explanations, or formatting.

CARD COUNT FLEXIBILITY:
- 4-6 cards: Focus on the most impactful signals with deeper explanations
- 7-9 cards: Standard comprehensive approach with balanced content  
- 10-12 cards: Include subtle signs and nuanced transformations for thorough coverage

WRITING GUIDELINES:
Tone & Style:
- Conversational and relatable - use "ty" (you) form
- Empathetic and understanding - acknowledge past struggles
- Hopeful and empowering - focus on growth and transformation
- Authentic - avoid overly motivational language

Content Principles:
- Contrast past vs. present behavior in each card
- Use specific, relatable examples (scrolling, eating, meaningless conversations)
- Include metaphors for deeper understanding (emotions as waves, energy as limited resource)
- Focus on internal transformation rather than external achievements
- Acknowledge that change is gradual and sometimes unnoticed

Language Patterns:
- Past tense indicators: "KiedyÅ›..." (Previously), "Dawniej..." (In the past)
- Present tense indicators: "DziÅ›..." (Today), "Teraz..." (Now)
- Transitional phrases: "To nie znaczy, Å¼e..." (This doesn't mean that...)
- Empowering statements: "Wiesz, Å¼e..." (You know that...)

Text Structure:
- Keep header concise and impactful
- Limit text to 2-3 paragraphs maximum per card
- Use \n\n for paragraph breaks in JSON
- Each main card should have past/present contrast

Example Topics:
- Personal growth and mental strength
- Relationship improvements
- Career development
- Healthy habits formation
- Emotional intelligence
- Self-confidence building
- Life balance and priorities
