WRITING GUIDELINES:
Tone & Style:

Conversational and relatable - use "ty" (you) form
Empathetic and understanding - acknowledge past struggles
Hopeful and empowering - focus on growth and transformation
Authentic - avoid overly motivational language

Content Principles:

Contrast past vs. present behavior in each card
Use specific, relatable examples (scrolling, eating, meaningless conversations)
Include metaphors for deeper understanding (emotions as waves, energy as limited resource)
Focus on internal transformation rather than external achievements
Acknowledge that change is gradual and sometimes unnoticed

Language Patterns:

Past tense indicators: "KiedyÅ›..." (Previously), "Dawniej..." (In the past)
Present tense indicators: "DziÅ›..." (Today), "Teraz..." (Now)
Transitional phrases: "To nie znaczy, Å¼e..." (This doesn't mean that...)
Empowering statements: "Wiesz, Å¼e..." (You know that...)

Formatting:

Use ðŸ”¹ for main content points
Use ðŸ‘‰ for actionable items and CTAs
Use ðŸ’¡ for insights and summaries
Separate each card with â¸»
Keep paragraphs short and scannable

Example Topics:

Personal growth and mental strength
Relationship improvements
Career development
Healthy habits formation
Emotional intelligence
Self-confidence building
Life balance and priorities
