Create a carousel post with the following structure in JSON format for a modern grid layout:

{
  "cards": [
    {
      "type": "hook",
      "header": "TITLE FORMAT: [MAIN GOAL/TRANSFORMATION]<br>[TIME FRAME OR METHOD]",
      "text": ""
    },
    {
      "type": "main",
      "header": "",
      "text": "1. [First step/principle]\n[Detailed explanation of this step - what it means, why it's important, how to implement it]\n\n[Optional: Key insight or practical tip with emoji prefix like üîë]"
    },
    {
      "type": "main", 
      "header": "",
      "text": "2. [Second step/principle]\n[Detailed explanation of this step]\n\n[Optional: Additional context or example]"
    },
    {
      "type": "main",
      "header": "",
      "text": "3. [Third step/principle]\n[Detailed explanation]\n\n[Optional: Practical application or warning]"
    },
    {
      "type": "main",
      "header": "",
      "text": "4. [Fourth step/principle]\n[Detailed explanation]\n\n[Optional: Motivational insight or next action]"
    },
    {
      "type": "main",
      "header": "",
      "text": "5. [Fifth step/principle]\n[Detailed explanation]\n\n[Optional: Final tip or encouragement]"
    }
  ]
}

CARD COUNT FLEXIBILITY:
The number of "main" cards can vary from 3 to 10, making the total number of cards between 4 and 11.

STYLE 2 SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:

Title Card (First Card):
- Use <br> tags for line breaks in the header to create visually appealing multi-line titles
- Focus on the main transformation or goal
- Include time frame when relevant (e.g., "W 1 ROK", "W 30 DNI", "KROK PO KROKU")
- Keep it inspiring and action-oriented
- The text field should remain empty for the title card

Content Cards (Main Cards):
- Each card starts with a numbered point (1., 2., 3., etc.)
- Follow the number with a clear, actionable principle or step
- Provide detailed explanation in the next paragraph
- Use double line breaks (\n\n) to separate sections within a card
- Include practical tips with emoji prefixes when helpful (üîë, üí°, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üéØ)

WRITING GUIDELINES:

Tone & Style:
- Direct and actionable - use "ty" (you) form
- Practical and implementable - focus on concrete steps

Content Principles:
- Each numbered point should be a complete, actionable step

- Include practical frameworks: "Przeanalizuj 8 obszar√≥w: zdrowie, finanse..."
- End with actionable insights or next steps

Formatting:
- Use numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) for main points
