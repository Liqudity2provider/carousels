Create a carousel post with the following structure in JSON format for a modern grid layout:

{
  "cards": [
    {
      "type": "hook",
      "text": "TITLE FORMAT: [MAIN GOAL/TRANSFORMATION]<br>[TIME FRAME OR METHOD]"
    },
    {
      "type": "main",
      "text": "1. [First step/principle title]\n[Brief, concise explanation - 2-3 sentences max]\n\n2. [Second step/principle title]\n[Brief explanation - 2-3 sentences max]\n\nüîë [Optional key insight]"
    },
    {
      "type": "main", 
      "text": "3. [Third step/principle title]\n[Brief explanation]\n\n4. [Fourth step/principle title]\n[Brief explanation]\n\nüí° [Optional tip]"
    },
    {
      "type": "main",
      "text": "5. [Fifth step/principle title]\n[Brief explanation]\n\n6. [Sixth step/principle title]\n[Brief explanation]\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è [Optional warning or note]"
    },
    {
      "type": "main",
      "text": "7. [Seventh step/principle title]\n[Brief explanation]\n\n8. [Eighth step/principle title]\n[Brief explanation]\n\nüéØ [Final actionable insight]"
    }
  ]
}

CARD COUNT FLEXIBILITY:
The number of "main" cards can vary from 3 to 6, making the total number of cards between 4 and 7.
Each main card can contain 1-2 numbered points to maximize space efficiency.

STYLE 2 SPECIFIC GUIDELINES:

Title Card (First Card):
- Use <br> tags for line breaks in the text to create visually appealing multi-line titles
- Focus on the main transformation or goal
- Include time frame when relevant (e.g., "W 1 ROK", "W 30 DNI", "KROK PO KROKU")
- Keep it inspiring and action-oriented
- No separate header field - everything goes in the text field

Content Cards (Main Cards):
- Each card starts with the first numbered point as the FIRST LINE of text
- The first line of each numbered point should be treated as a heading (will be styled as h4)
- Follow with explanation text that should be normal weight and smaller
- Structure: "1. First point title\n[explanation]\n\n2. Second point title\n[explanation]"
- Keep each point to 2-3 sentences maximum for conciseness
- Use double line breaks (\n\n) to separate multiple points within a card
- Include practical tips with emoji prefixes sparingly (üîë, üí°, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üéØ)

WRITING GUIDELINES:

Tone & Style:
- Direct and actionable - use "ty" (you) form
- Practical and implementable - focus on concrete steps
- Motivational but realistic - acknowledge challenges
- Professional yet approachable

Content Principles:
- Each numbered point title should be concise but descriptive (will be styled as h4)
- Each numbered point should be concise but actionable (2-3 sentences max)
- Combine 2 related points per card when space allows
- Focus on practical implementation over theory
- Use specific, relatable examples briefly
- Prioritize clarity and immediate applicability

Language Patterns:
- Numbered point titles: Use clear, benefit-focused language: "Zbuduj podstawy", "Ustaw granice", "Zmie≈Ñ nawyki"
- Content: Start with action verbs: "Zacznij od...", "Ustaw...", "Stw√≥rz..."
- Keep explanations brief and direct
- End points with concrete next steps or key insights

Formatting:
- Use numbered lists (1., 2., 3.) for main points
- Use üîë for key insights
- Use üí° for important realizations  
- Use ‚ö†Ô∏è for warnings or things to avoid
- Use üéØ for specific actions or goals
- Keep paragraphs concise and scannable
